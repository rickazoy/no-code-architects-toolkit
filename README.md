# No-Code Architects Toolkit API 

Tired of wasting thousands of dollars on API subscriptions to support all your automations? What if there was a free alternative?

The 100% FREE No-Code Architects Toolkit API processes different types of media. It is built in Python using Flask.

## What Can It Do?

The API can convert audio files. It creates transcriptions of content. It translates content between languages. It adds captions to videos. It can do very complicated media processing for content creation. The API can also manage files across multiple cloud services like Google Drive, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Dropbox.

You can deploy this toolkit in several ways. It works with Docker. It runs on Google Cloud Platform. It functions on Digital Ocean. You can use it with any system that hosts Docker.

Easily replace services like ChatGPT Whisper, Cloud Convert, Createomate, JSON2Video, PDF(dot)co, Placid and OCodeKit.

  - New users receive $300 in free credits.
- Basic knowledge of GCP services such as Cloud Run and Cloud Storage.
- A terminal or code editor for managing files.

---

## **Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project**
1. Log into the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on the **Project Selector** in the top navigation bar and select **New Project**.
3. Enter a project name, such as `NCA Toolkit Project`.
4. Click **Create**.

---

## **Step 2: Enable Required APIs**

- **Cloud Run API**

### **How to Enable APIs:**
1. In the GCP Console, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Enable APIs and Services**.
2. Search for each API, click on it, and enable it.

---

## **Step 3: Create a Service Account**
1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts** in the GCP Console.
2. Click **+ Create Service Account**.
   - Enter a name (e.g., `NCA Toolkit Service Account`).
3. Assign the following roles to the service account:
   - **Storage Admin**
   - **Viewer**
4. Click **Done** to create the service account.
5. Open the service account details and navigate to the **Keys** tab.
   - Click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
   - Choose **JSON** format, download the file, and store it securely.

---

## **Step 4: Create a Cloud Storage Bucket**
1. Navigate to **Storage** > **Buckets** in the GCP Console.
2. Click **+ Create Bucket**.
   - Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., `nca-toolkit-bucket`).
   - Leave default settings, but:
     - Uncheck **Enforce public access prevention**.
     - Set **Access Control** to **Uniform**.
3. Click **Create** to finish.
4. Go to the bucket permissions, and add **allUsers** as a principal with the role:
   - **Storage Object Viewer**.
5. Save changes.

---

## **Step 5: Deploy on Google Cloud Run**

### 1. Navigate to Cloud Run
- Open the **Cloud Run** service in the **Google Cloud Console**.

### 2. Create a New Service
- Click **Create Service**.
- Then **Deploy one revision from Docker Hub using the image below**:

  ```
  stephengpope/no-code-architects-toolkit:latest
  ```

### 3. Allow Unauthenticated Invocations
- Check the box to **allow unauthenticated invocations**.

### 4. Configure Resource Allocation
- Set **Memory**: `16 GB`.
- Set **CPU**: `4 CPUs`.
- Set **CPU Allocation**: **Always Allocated**.

### 5. Adjust Scaling Settings
- **Minimum Instances**: `0` (to minimize cost during idle times).
- **Maximum Instances**: `5` (adjustable based on expected load).

### 6. Use Second-Generation Servers
- Scroll to **Platform Version** and select **Second Generation**.
- Second-generation servers offer better performance and feature support for advanced use cases.

### 7. Add Environment Variables
- Add the following environment variables:
- `API_KEY`: Your API key (e.g., `Test123`).
- `GCP_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your Cloud Storage bucket.
- `GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS`: The JSON key of your service account.
  - Paste the **entire contents** of the downloaded JSON key file into this field.
  - Ensure:
    - Proper JSON formatting.
    - No leading or trailing spaces.

### 8. Configure Advanced Settings
- Set the **Container Port**: Default to `8080`.
- **Request Timeout**: `300 seconds` (to handle long-running requests).
- Enable **Startup Boost** to improve performance for the first request after a cold start.

### 9. Deploy the Service
- Verify all settings and click **Create**.
- The deployment process might take a few minutes. Once completed, a green checkmark should appear in the Cloud Run dashboard.

By following these steps, the NCA Toolkit will be successfully deployed and accessible via Google Cloud Run with second-generation servers for optimal performance.

---

## **Step 6: Test the Deployment**

1. Install **[Postman Template](https://bit.ly/49Gkh61)** on your computer.
2. Import the API example requests from the NCA Toolkit GitHub repository.
3. Configure two environment variables in Postman:
   - `base_url`: Your deployed Cloud Run service URL.
   - `x-api-key`: The API key you configured in **Step 5**.
4. Use the example requests to validate that the API is functioning correctly.
5. Use the **[NCA Toolkit API GPT](https://bit.ly/4feDDk4)** to learn more.

By following these steps, your NCA Toolkit API should be successfully deployed on Google Cloud Platform.
